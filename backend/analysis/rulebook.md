Below is the **fully updated, clean, consolidated, professional version** of your trading system—**v1.2**—now including the new **MACD Distribution Timing Framework** and all prior rules.

I’ve kept everything crisp, hierarchical, and execution-ready.

---

# **📘 Eric’s Trading System — Full Restatement (v1.2)**

*A rules-based framework for long/short setups, timing, confluence, and options execution.*

---

# **I. Multi-Timeframe Structure Scan**

### **Long Setups**

* Evaluate **1W → 1D → 1H**.
* Higher timeframes must look **bullish**.

### **Short Setups**

* Evaluate **1D → 1H** (optional: 15m refinement).
* Must align with **bearish structure** *and not fight a strong higher-timeframe uptrend*.

**Core Question:**

> **Does this chart lean bullish, bearish, or neither? If neither → skip.**

---

# **II. Indicator Confirmation Layer**

## **A. MACD — Acceleration Check**

Is MACD positioned to accelerate in the desired direction?

Signals:

* **Reversal:** histogram flips (red→blue for longs, blue→red for shorts)
* **Continuation:** dark → light color shifts (increasing momentum)

**If yes → +1 evidence.**

---

## **B. Fisher Transform — Outlier Check**

FT positioning for explosive moves:

* **Bullish:** curling upward from below **–1.5**
* **Bearish:** turning down from above **+1.5**

**If yes → +1 evidence.**

---

## **C. Fisher Transform — Mean Reversion Check**

If not an outlier setup:

* FT has already peaked at extremes (±1.5+)
* Multiple peaks strengthen signal
* FT rolling over → mean reversion probability increases

**If yes → +1 evidence.**

---

# **III. Price Location Rules**

## **A. Universal Rule**

> **Price must be at the extreme of a local range.
> Avoid trades in the middle of ranges.**

---

## **B. Short-Specific Location Rule (Critical)**

> **Short ONLY at the *top* of a range.
> Never short at the bottom or during breakdowns without retests.**

Requirements:

* Defined range top / supply zone
* Multiple touches or failed breakouts
* Clear invalidation just above range

Auto-disqualifiers:

* Shorting into demand
* Shorting breakdowns at the bottom
* Shorting after an extended down move

---

# **IV. Short Setup Extra Conditions**

Because shorts have lower expectancy, require additional confluence:

* **SPX 4H consolidation box** (± ~1.25% range)
* **VIX near ~16 or lower** (complacency regime)
* **Clear supply zone overhead**
* **Sentiment euphoria while price stalls**

Each adds conviction.

---

# **V. Narrative Divergence Check**

Ask whether price behavior contradicts current narratives:

* Bearish reaction to good news → short
* Bullish reaction to bad news → long
* Euphoria but flat price → topping
* Panic headlines but steady price → bottoming

**If divergence exists → +1 evidence.**

---

# **VI. Evidence Threshold → R/R → Position Sizing**

Enter trades only when sufficient confluence exists:

### **Minimum Requirements:**

* **3+ strong technical evidence signals**, or
* **2 strong + 2 contextual signals** (VIX, narrative, range, consolidation)

Then:

1. Define **target**
2. Define **invalidation**
3. Calculate **R/R**
4. Size based on volatility (ATR) and stop distance

**Only take trades where asymmetry is clear.**

---

# **VII. Options Execution Rules**

## **1. DTE Rule**

> **Use ≤ 30 DTE for active directional trades.**
> Longer DTE is for swing structure, not tactical setups.

---

## **2. Take Profits Early (Front-Loaded Payoff Rule)**

Directional options pay early, not late.

> **At 2–5× return, scale out or close.
> Do NOT hold through decay hoping for outliers.**

Your silver execution (5× exit → would be 2× today) is a perfect example.

---

## **3. House Money Re-Entry Principle**

> **Bank the win early. If the move continues, re-enter with a fraction of realized profits.**

Benefits:

* Prevents round-tripping
* Provides psychological relief
* Creates equity ratchet
* Maintains exposure when justified

---

## **4. No Greed Rule**

> **Capture the asymmetric portion of the move. Not the whole move.**

Short-dated options penalize overstaying.

---

# **VIII. MACD Distribution Timing Framework (New)**

Your dynamic MACD run-length table—mean, median, distribution percentiles—governs hold times.

---

## **A. Counter-Trend Trades (Against MACD Color)**

*(shorting during blue MACD, longing during red MACD)*

### **A1 — Expect to Hold Through the Lower 30% of Runs**

Typically **1–4 days**.
Avoid premature exits when MACD stays against you briefly.

### **A2 — Look for Reversal in Days 4–8**

This window captures the most common point where MACD flips.

### **A3 — Hard Exit by Median (~Day 9)**

Do NOT hold a counter-trend trade beyond the typical cycle length.
Prevents overextension and trend-fighting disasters.

---

## **B. Continuation Trades (With MACD Color)**

*(longing during blue MACD, shorting during red MACD)*

### **B1 — Do NOT Bet on Outlier MACD Run Lengths**

Continuation trades must assume normal distributions, not tail events.

Prevents:

* Buying tops after long blue runs
* Shorting bottoms after long red runs

### **B2 — Continuation Trades Must Be Taken Early in the Run**

If the MACD run is already >70th percentile in length:

> **Avoid continuation trades entirely.**

This eliminates:

* FOMO tops
* Shorts “into the hole”
* Late entries into exhaustion

---

# **IX. Summary Flow (Execution Checklist)**

1. **Trend:** Higher timeframe structural bias
2. **Indicators:** MACD + Fisher confirmations
3. **Price Location:** Extreme of range (top for shorts)
4. **Short Extras:** VIX, consolidation, supply zone
5. **Narrative Divergence:** Behavior vs. sentiment
6. **MACD Timing:** Counter-trend/continuation windows
7. **R/R:** Clear target, clear invalidation
8. **Options Execution:** ≤30 DTE, take profits early, re-enter with house money

Enter only when the full system aligns.
